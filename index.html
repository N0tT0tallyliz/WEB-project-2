        /* the body style which the colour scheme: Its Monochromatic and i used the color palette app for this, i chose Brown because according to color pyschgology
     it represents loyalty and security and also grounding which relates to treaty in my opinion because the loyalty means staying true to something and i feel like  
     the treaty was ann agreement that everyone stayed true to and kept their promises.The treaty was a form of security to the indigenous people to protect themselves from very nasty racist behaviours.
