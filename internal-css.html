      <!-- These are short facts about each treaty from 1 to 5 -->
      <span class="bold">Treaty 1 (1871)</span> – Southern Manitoba (Winnipeg). Promised land, money, tools, and schools. Land disputes followed.<br>
      <span class="bold">Treaty 2 (1871)</span> – Southwestern Manitoba. Similar to Treaty 1 but with land concerns.<br>
      <span class="bold">Treaty 3 (1873)</span> – Northwestern Ontario & Manitoba. Promised land, hunting rights, and payments. Many misunderstandings.<br>
      <span class="bold">Treaty 4 (1874)</span> – Southern Saskatchewan & parts of Alberta/Manitoba. Promised land, payments, and education. Delays in support.<br>
      <span class="bold">Treaty 5 (1875)</span> – Central/Northern Manitoba & Ontario. Promised land, hunting rights, and schools. Hard to enforce due to distance.<br>
    </p>
    <p>These treaties still impact Indigenous rights in Canada today.</p>
